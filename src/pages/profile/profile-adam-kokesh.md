Adam Kokesh has been a libertarian activist for almost a decade and a half. 

* His activism started with participation in [Iraq Veterans Against the War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Veterans_Against_the_War) in 2007.
* In 2008, Kokesh volunteered in Ron Paul's presidential campaign when he spoke at Ron Paul's [Rally for the Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_for_Liberty#Rally_for_the_Republic) in St. Paul, Minnesota.
* In 2009, Kokesh and other activists participated in a silent dance at the Thomas Jefferson Memorial in protest against a recent ruling against dancing within the monument. Kokesh was violently body slammed and arrested along with other protesters.
* In 2011 Adam hosted an RT America TV show *Adam vs. The Man*
* In 2012, Kokesh again helped in Ron Pauls presidential campaign.
* In 2013, Kokesh announced an  "Open Carry March on Washington" by posting a YouTube video of him allegedly loading a shotgun in Freedom Plaza in Washington, DC. Five days after this video, Kokesh was arrested when a SWAT team raided his house in Virginia. 

Kokesh initially faced controversy in 2016 when an ex-girlfriend of his came forth alleging abusive behavior, including being coerced into signing a contract regarding her behavior in the relationship. This incident led to many of Kokesh's campaign staffers to abandon Kokesh's presidential campaign.\

Recently, Kokesh has made transphobic tweets mocking the transgender individuals request to respect their chosen pronouns.
