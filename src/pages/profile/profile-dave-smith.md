#### Disclaimers

At the time of this writing, Dave has 670 podcast episodes that usually run over an hour and thousands of tweets. The following write up is based on the research in mid november of approximately 10 cumulative hours of listening to Dave’s Part of the Problem podcast as well as additional time reviewing Dave’s social media posts. The episodes were primarily ones where Dave had a guest. Equivalent time was given to episodes with guests that Rebel Rabbits either likes, dislikes, or doesn’t know. Rebel Rabbits acknowledges this is a small sample and requests users contact the site with any updated information.

Additionally, the vast majority of Dave's podcast episodes are behind a paywall and cannot be directly linked. Episodes with time stamps have been marked for sources.

## In his own words

Dave Smith bills himself as a libertarian whose primary goal is spreading the libertarian message. Dave believes a libertarian’s primary focus should be war and prescribes that war should be the primary focus for libertarians generally. From Dave’s perspective, focusing on smaller issues, such as racism, is at best a very poor allocation of time and resources and at worst harms the success of marketing the libertarian philosophy (in the case of racism because “the libertarian’s current demographic make up is 97% white” \[POTP #557, @41:05]).

More specifically, Dave's thoughts on the following:

* Dave on holocaust denial…

  * Asks “Why is that the most horrible thing ever?” if someone questions the validity of the holocaust \[POTP #549]
  * "Like my gripes with the America first crowd, you know like I don’t have the problems that everyone else has with them. I’m not like 'oh they made a racist joke' or you know, they did this or one of them’s a Holocaust denier or something. I just don’t care about any of that stuff. Like, I’m very confident the Holocaust happened but like if someone believes it didn’t happen like I don’t I don’t understand why this is so consequential. Like it’s okay you got one kind of goofy stupid view or something, whatever.” \[POTP #557 @30:50]
  * Called an infamous holocaust denial joke by “hilarious” \[POTP #549]
* Dave on Racism...

  * Dave claims the real victims of racism are white “I just think that there’s not really a huge problem of racism, certainly amongst libertarians. You could argue there’s a huge problem of racism in the country right now but it’s pretty much all… uh… coming in one direction, and it’s not the one that you guys are thinking of.”\[POTP #626 @7:48]
  * Argues that libertarians cannot be anti-racist activists while believing in free choice, "But if you're talking about someone's like personal preference, who they want to hang out with, who they want to live around, who they want to be— well first off, libertarian, you've got a problem because that's a free choice, and you're supposed to believe in freedom of association and people have a right to prefer what they want to, so there's a problem." \[POTP #557 @39:20]
  * Denies there is a legitimate reason for libertarians to be vocally anti-racist, "But why are you obsessing over this as like the big concern and the only answer seems to be, what you're saying, that it's like this attempt to virtue signal to try to be like hey look I'm not one of these bad people" \[POTP #557 @39:30]
* Said Twitter banning accounts for exhibitions of transphobia is equivalent to a “whites only sign” \[POTP #549]
* Dave has expressed his serious concern over the “demographic consequences”, "dual loyalty", and "tribal allegiances" of legal immigration \[POTP#557 @22:00] and claims the closed border position is no more or less libertarian than the open borders positions \[POTP #578 @14:00]
* As a strategy towards spreading the libertarian message, Dave seems to think that it is more appropriate or likely for libertarian on the right versus the left, “because the left will never accept you”  \[POTP #557].

As an additional goal, Dave wants to expand the conversation on cultural commentary, which he sees as too small a range of acceptable behavior. Dave has said he’s fine with having very uncomfortable and non- politically correct conversations to get to the truth of a matter\[POTP #624, @33:00] . Towards these goals, Dave hosts people he labels as interesting, which includes multiple Unite the Right Rally members and VDare contributors. Dave has told his guests that he doesn’t care about their own or their affiliations real or imagined bigotry or holocaust denial, and instead takes humor in jokes on the subject. Dave acknowledges that he takes joy in “melting snowflakes” \[POTP #557, 0:45].

## Why he is here

If Dave Smith were merely an anti-war activist, libertarian or otherwise, this platform would support him. However, he uses his declared anti-war stance to platform and praise fascists and other right leaning authoritarians. These are individuals and groups who may purport to be non-interventionism in their foreign policy proposals, but are otherwise odiously opposed to libertarianism and human decency more generally.

Dave hosts white nationalists, white supremacists, America Firsters and VDare contributes and inappropriately praises their illiberal right wing populism of his podcast guests as anti-conservative establishment. For example, After Malkin stated multiple awful and anti-libertarian reasons for why she voted for Trump (anti immigration, etc), Dave praises her for being anti conservative establishment without any qualification \[POTP #557 @15:00]. This is a low bar that any neo nazi would also achieve.

Along with other low bars that should be met for libertarianism or human decency more generally are other issues. Dave has claimed the real problem with racism is anti-white racism. Dave claims that libertarian have no legitimate reason to talk about racism other than to virtue signal. Dave thinks it is an objective fact that white, on average, have higher IQs than black. Dave draws false equivalence to private businesses having anti-bigotry rules and private business having bigoted rules. Dave insinuates the relative harmlessness of holocaust denialism. Dave will claim ignorance or denial of any dangerous behavior of a guest who, at the time of this writing, has [32 targeted articles about on Right Wing Watch](https://www.rightwingwatch.org/people/nick-fuentes/). All of these were said with his podcast conversations with guests.

Analyzing the political demographics of Dave’s guests and how Dave interacted with them is also worthy of note. As of Nov 18, when Part of The Problem episode 670 was the most recent episode, an evaluation of Dave’s last 15-20 (non regular) guests can be described (or who self-identify) as either:

1. Libertarian. Dave’s libertarian guests encompass the majority of his guests. However, your mileage will seriously vary. There are individuals with typical libertarian positions like Spike Cohen to Peter “monarchy is preferable to democracy” Quinones and Jeff “blood and soil” Deist)
2. Right wing authoritarians that include white nationalist, Unite the Right attendees to VDare contributing, American Firsters.

Among the sample of episodes watched, it was illustrated that Dave’s behavior towards these two types of guests differed. During his conversations with libertarians, for example Spike Cohen, Chris Spangle, or Jen Monroe, Dave was far more likely to challenge any differences of opinion and explore those differences of opinion. With right wingers like Malkin or Fuentes, there might be, on rare occasion, an acknowledgement of difference, but that difference was almost never challenged. For example, with Dave’s conversation with Malkin, there was a single time where he stated a disagreement which was directed toward the America Firsters. Namely, their lack of support for “free markets”, but that was it. There was no follow up to try and convince his guest of the efficacy of free markets. With Nick Fuentes, rather than discussing important disagreements that Dave, or libertarians, more generally, Dave hammered the focus home that libertarians and nationalists like Fuentes had significant overlap.

Rebel Rabbit’s concluding takeaway when he analyzes Dave’s actions in his podcasts and social media posts is as follows. While Dave frequently says good things that are wholly consistent with the ethical individualism and political conclusions of libertarianism, Dave also has a dangerous habit of platforming, praising, and persisting fascist propaganda. Dave challenges libertarians on traditional libertarian positions such as freedom of immigration and anti-racism. Dave dismisses traditional libertarian concerns of right wing populism such as transphobia, nationalism, anti-semitism, and how the worst policies committed by the US government were birthed from the dehumanization at the core of racism (**don't like this sentence. needs to be fleshed out more**). Dave validates the concerns of his right wing guests over consequences of demographic change, immigration, anti-white racism as the real racism, claiming racial differences in IQ as objective fact,  interpreting 9/11 as a legal immigration issue, drawing false equivalency between biggoted rules and anti-bigotry rules [**any others**?], and claiming that the left, “who will never accept you”, is the real antagonist.
