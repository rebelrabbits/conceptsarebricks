I'm not sure how one can possibly claim this with a straight face. According to GLAAD, an organization dedicated to accelerating acceptance for the LGBTQ community, Trump has a [staggeringly poor record regarding LGBT](https://www.glaad.org/trump).

Compare this to Biden who, according [Pink News](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/11/07/joe-biden-lgbt-gay-rights-record-voted-defence-of-marriage-act-marriage-equality/), is the far preferable candidate (despite the fact he has a checkered history)
