<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t know about you, but I will sleep a lot better knowing that trans people can also slaughter innocent people in third world countries. That’s what justice looks like!</p>&mdash; Dave Smith (@ComicDaveSmith) <a href="https://twitter.com/ComicDaveSmith/status/1353758446953365504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2021</a></blockquote>\

This tweet is in context to [Biden reverses Trump’s ban on transgender people enlisting in the military](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/biden-reverses-trumps-ban-on-transgender-people-enlisting-in-the-military.html). Again, the issue is the ending of an explicitly discriminatory government hiring practice against trans people.

As [@ileadliberty](https://twitter.com/ileadliberty) eloquently put it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">By conflating &quot;war bad&quot; with &quot;military bad&quot; with &quot;military hiring bad,&quot; he finds a position with plausible deniability from which to suggest the idea that refusing to hire trans people is actually \*good.\* He is attempting to displace feelings towards the military onto trans ppl.</p>&mdash; Leading Liberty 🧤🏴 (@ileadliberty) <a href="https://twitter.com/ileadliberty/status/1353764252507648010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2021</a></blockquote> 

The logic of Dave's tweet is identical to the argument for the abolition of the 19th Amendment used in the cringe corners of the edge-lord libertarian spaces.
