In the following tweet, Kokesh mocks the request from transgender individuals to use their pronouns of choice:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is just some of the crap <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/trans?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#trans</a> ppl like me have to put up w on <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Twitter</a>. I can&#39;t even talk about my own pronouns wo being labeled a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/transphobe?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#transphobe</a>. Some ppl pretend to be libertarians in order to give this compassionate philosophy a bad name. <a href="https://twitter.com/ileadliberty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ileadliberty</a> is def one. Blocked. <a href="https://t.co/1wkEPPzq8L">https://t.co/1wkEPPzq8L</a></p>&mdash; Adam FREEDOM!

This tweet is offensive to the dignity of transgender individuals because it belittle's their request for others to respect their chosen pronouns as a flippant lifestyle decision.\
\
Another twitter users compared Kokesh's actions to a person wearing blackface while accusing others of racism \[for not acknowledging blackface wearers purported identity].\

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">putting king in your profile as a &quot;pronoun&quot; and then mockingly claiming it makes you transgender as a defense against criticism is low brow shit, like wearing black face while accusing people of racism level absolute clown shit. You fucking clown.
