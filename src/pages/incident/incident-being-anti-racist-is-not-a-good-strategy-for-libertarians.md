**Context:**

This quote immediately follows in a conversation with Michelle Malkin where Dave has been explaining why:

- Anti-racist activism is incompatible with valuing freedom of choice
- There is no valid reason for libertarian to discuss racism
- Cannot discuss racism consistently without mentioning the "completely accepted" anti-white hatred

Dave continues, stating that libertarians discussing opposition to racism...

> ...is not a good strategy. \[Libertarians]\* are 97% white so maybe you shouldnâ€™t go ahead with demonizing what is your entire base. Just for marketing purposes, if nothing else.

\* Dave's actual quote uses pronoun "you" but he is addressing libertarians.
