Dave does not believe a libertarian can be anti-racist without being against free choice.

Dave does not believe a libertarian has any valid reason to be anti-racist.

> When you mean racism like what do you mean? Do you mean slavery? Do you mean genocide? Do you mean like some horrible state action? Okay, then great, let's all be against that. But if you're talking about someone's like personal preference, who they want to hang out with, who they want to live around, who they want to beâ€” well first off, libertarian, you've got a problem because that's a free choice, and you're supposed to believe in freedom of association and people have a right to prefer what they want to, so there's a problem. But why are you obsessing over this as like the big concern and the only answer seems to be, what you're saying, that it's like this attempt to virtue signal to try to be like hey look I'm not one of these bad people.
