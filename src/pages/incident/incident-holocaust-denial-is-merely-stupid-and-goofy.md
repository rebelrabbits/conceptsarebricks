Dave doesn't understand the dangers of holocaust denial.

> Like my gripes with the America first crowd, you know like I don’t have the problems that everyone else has with them. I’m not like 'oh they made a racist joke' or you know, they did this or one of them’s a Holocaust denier or something. I just don’t care about any of that stuff. Like, I’m very confident the Holocaust happened but like if someone believes it didn’t happen like I don’t I don’t understand why this is so consequential. Like it’s okay you got one kind of goofy stupid view or something, whatever.
