Petersen has made a series of tweets insinuating or making direct accusations
of election fraud... without evidence.\

At the time of this post, Nov 11, there has yet to have been evidence put forth to substantiate these accusations.

Petersen doesn't seem concerned by this. He seems happy to side with an authoritarian president.
