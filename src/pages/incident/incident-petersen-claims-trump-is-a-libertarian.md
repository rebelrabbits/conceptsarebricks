Petersen has made this statement to some degree on multiple tweets. You
know...because words don't have meaning. For example:

H/T to [@BadLibertarianTakes](https://twitter.com/BadLibertarians) for finding these

As Being Libertarian eloquently stated in [Donald Trump Is No Libertarian](https://beinglibertarian.com/donald-trump-no-libertarian/),

> Donald Trump is authoritarian, and there is no argument against that which holds any merit. That does not mean we can’t give him some credit where it is due. Reducing regulations and government power is good. A handful of good things however is not “winning”.
