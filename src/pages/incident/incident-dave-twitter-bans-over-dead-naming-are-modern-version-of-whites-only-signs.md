> “But it drives me crazy when I hear libertarians say like ‘well they're a private business, they can do whatever they want to.’ I mean libertarians always talk about how like, well if some private business were discriminating I get you know, if they hung up a whites-only sign or something like that, I would be the first, you know, we would boycott and we would do all this and we would say they're horrible and all this and then the market would sort all of it out. But here you have in real time, like, our modern-day version of that which is basically that if you want to say like, no, I if I want to refer to Caitlyn Jenner as ‘Bruce Jenner’ on Twitter I get kicked off of Twitter for doing that, and the market doesn't seem to be solving the problem. Obviously it's not a completely free market, but at the very least I think libertarians should be out there condemning them."

It is a common theme for Dave to draw false equivalence to lend normalcy and even victim status to fascist policies and bigotry. Obviously, the "Whites Only" signs of old and Twitter's enforcement of their rules of conduct are both forms of discrimination. However, the devil is in the details: _Who_ is being discriminated against? And _why?_ It should be obvious to all that discriminating against an inherent, non-changeable, identity is completely different from discriminating against bigoted, changeable, behavior.
