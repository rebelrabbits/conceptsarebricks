In early 2021, text transcripts were leaked involving Jeffrey Tucker, who worked from 1997 to 2011 as editorial vice president and editor for the institute's website,Â [Mises.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mises.org "Mises.org"). In these transcripts, Tucker claims:

* The Mises Institute is an "onboarding institution for the alt-right"
* "These people \[meaning Deist and others] have dabbled in very bad shit for a long time, but mostly in private"
* "I know exactly why Deist is prez... and it is not about libertarianism"
