I. WHAT IS CANCEL/CALLOUT CULTURE? - members of a community with relatively little individual social power using their collective social power to accuse, embarrass, and/or deplatform a prominent member of that community.\
- How does it work?\
- How does it differ from criticism, debate, or other forms of vocalized disapproval? (abstraction, essentialism, and assumption of guilt)

II: WHAT'S THE APPEAL?\
- Justice for people who are normally denied it by powerful people who are insulated within the system (e.g., #CancelRKelly)\
- Disrupts the narrative that victims must have done something to deserve the abuse\
- Gives victims a sense of community and support (#MeToo)

III: WHAT'S THE DOWNSIDE?\
- Can be weaponized by people who, in bad faith, want to hide behind a victim status.\
- Abstraction eliminates nuance, which makes all "bad actors" seem equally bad and worthy of punishment (e.g., James Charles = tries to trick straight men (act) = is manipulative and toxic (essential trait) = sexual predator (general umbrella of evil) = as bad as Weinstein/Cosby/etc.)\
- Anonymity allows participants to avoid confronting real-world consequences of their actions (e.g., adult actress who committed suicide)\
- Legitimately abusive behavior (doxxing, threatening, harassing) feels justified by the righteous frenzy that surrounds the target.

IV: WHAT SHOULD WE DO?\
- Recognize the tendency to rally behind a witchhunt and scrutinize every instance you encounter for legitimacy (link to an article ("Should a Person be Canceled?") about when behavior callout should transition to a character condemnation)\
- Understand that no universal formula is going to apply, but some good questions one can ask are:\
*Is it possible that this person is acting from ignorance, not hate?* If so, are they open to discussion?\
*Is it possible that I am wrong in my assessment of their behavior?* Even if their action is hurtful, is it harmful or dangerous (e.g., CounterPoints talking about Daddy Kink versus JK Rowling implying that trans women are predatory men).
