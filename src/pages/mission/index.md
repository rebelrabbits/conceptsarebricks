# Mission Statement

Guarding against bigotry and authoritarian entryism in libertarian spaces.

# Goals

A. Accountability Rather Than Cancellation

- just because a person or organization performs an action that contains some for of bigotry or facilitates authoritarian entryism, that doesn't mean they deserve to cancelled. Everyone, including Rebel Rabbits, has said regrettable things on social media

B. Judging Action, Not People

- One bad tweet or one blindspot does not define a person or organization

C. Encouraging Evolution and Growth Rather Than Punishment

- Every single person has said or done something regrettable and has grown from it
- Just as this platform holds accountable potentially harmful actions, so does it pledge be public when the person behind that action has shown genuine growth.
